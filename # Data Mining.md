Data mining is the process of extracting useful information from large sets of data.
It involves using various techniques from statistics, machine learning, and database systems to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in the data.
This information is used to make data-driven decisions, solve business problems, and uncover hidden insights.
Applications of data mining include customer profiling and segmentation, market basket analysis, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling.
Data mining tools and technologies are widely used in various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and telecommunications.
In general terms, “Mining” is the process of extraction of some valuable material from the earth e.g. coal mining, diamond mining, etc.
It is basically the process carried out for the extraction of useful information from a bulk of data or data warehouses. 
One can see that the term itself is a little confusing. In the case of coal or diamond mining, the result of the extraction process is coal or diamond. 
In that sense, we can think of Data Mining as a step in the process of Knowledge Discovery or Knowledge Extraction.
But in the case of Data Mining, the result of the extraction process is not data Instead, data mining results are the patterns and knowledge that we gain at the end of the extraction process.
The term ‘data mining’ became more popular in the business and press communities. Currently, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery are used interchangeably. 
Now a days, data mining is used in almost all places where a large amount of data is stored and processed.
For example, banks typically use ‘data mining’ to find out their prospective customers who could be interested in credit cards, personal loans, or insurance as well. 
Data mining has been integrated with many other techniques from other domains such as statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, database and data warehouse systems, information retrieval, visualization, etc. 
Technically, data mining is the computational process of analyzing data from different perspectives, dimensions, angles and categorizing/summarizing it into meaningful information. 
Data Pre-processing – Data cleaning, integration, selection, and transformation takes place.
Data Extraction – Occurrence of exact data mining.
Data Evaluation and Presentation – Analyzing and presenting results.
Data mining can provide valuable insights that can help organizations make better decisions by identifying patterns and trends in large data sets.
Data mining can automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as data cleaning and preparation, which can help organizations save time and resources.
Data mining can help organizations gain a competitive edge by uncovering new business opportunities and identifying areas for improvement.
Data mining can help organizations better understand their customers and tailor their products and services to meet their needs.
Data mining can be used to identify fraudulent activities by detecting unusual patterns and anomalies in data.
Data mining can be used to build models that can predict future events and trends, which can be used to make proactive decisions.
Data mining can be used to identify new product opportunities by analyzing customer purchase patterns and preferences.
Data mining can be used to identify potential risks by analyzing data on customer behavior, market conditions, and other factors.
It is a technique that gives the careful study of purchases done by a customer in a supermarket. 
The concept is basically applied to identify the items that are bought together by a customer. 
This analysis helps in promoting offers and deals by the companies.
This can help us to detects calls made on cloned phones. Similarly, with credit cards, comparing purchases with historical purchases can detect activity with stolen cards.
The evolution of data warehousing technology and the growth of big data.
Data mining has improved organizational decision-making through insightful data analyses.
These methods are used to organize and filter data, surfacing the most interesting information, from fraud detection to user behaviors, bottlenecks, and even security breaches.
Data mining usually consists of four main steps: setting objectives, data gathering and preparation, applying data mining algorithms, and evaluating results.
Analysts may also need to do additional research to understand the business context appropriately.
Data mining works by using various algorithms and techniques to turn large volumes of data into useful information.
An association rule is a rule-based method for finding relationships between variables in a given dataset. 
This data mining technique uses classification or regression methods to classify or predict potential outcomes based on a set of decisions. 
Educational institutions have started to collect data to understand their student populations as well as which environments are conducive to success.
They can use a variety of dimensions and metrics to observe and evaluate performance, such as keystroke, student profiles, classes, universities, time spent, etc.
The data mining process can detect surprising and intriguing relationships and patterns in seemingly unrelated bits of information. 
While frequently occurring patterns in data can provide teams with valuable insight, observing data anomalies is also beneficial, assisting companies in detecting fraud.
The real inflection point came in the 1960s with the development of relational database technology and user-oriented natural language query tools like Structured Query Language (SQL).
No longer was data only available through custom coded programs.
Data mining has traditionally been a specialty skill set within data science.
Data mining is a key component of business intelligence. Data mining tools are built into executive dashboards, harvesting insight from Big Data, including data from social media, Internet of Things (IoT) sensor feeds,etc.
Modern data mining relies on the cloud and virtual computing, as well in-memory databases, to manage data from many sources cost-effectively and to scale on demand.
Your internal systems and databases. Link them through their data models and various relational tools or gather the data together into a data warehouse.
Data preparation and cleansing may be an ongoing task as new projects or data from new fields of inquiry become of interest.
Keep in mind that data mining is based on a tool kit rather than a fixed routine or process.
