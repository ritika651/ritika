Data mining is the process of extracting useful information from large sets of data.
It involves using various techniques from statistics, machine learning, and database systems to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in the data.
This information can then be used to make data-driven decisions, solve business problems, and uncover hidden insights.
Data mining tools and technologies are widely used in various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and telecommunications.
In general terms, “Mining” is the process of extraction of some valuable material from the earth e.g. coal mining, diamond mining, etc. 
It is basically the process carried out for the extraction of useful information from a bulk of data or data warehouses. 
In the case of coal or diamond mining, the result of the extraction process is coal or diamond.
But in the case of Data Mining, the result of the extraction process is not data Instead, data mining results are the patterns and knowledge that we gain at the end of the extraction process. 
Now a days, data mining is used in almost all places where a large amount of data is stored and processed.
Data mining can provide valuable insights that can help organizations make better decisions by identifying patterns and trends in large data sets.
Data mining can help organizations better understand their customers and tailor their products and services to meet their needs.
Data mining can be used to identify fraudulent activities by detecting unusual patterns and anomalies in data.
Data mining can be used to build models that can predict future events and trends, which can be used to make proactive decisions.
Before learning the concepts of Data Mining, you should have a basic understanding of Statistics, Database Knowledge, and Basic programming language.
Real-worlds data is usually stored on various platforms in a distributed computing environment.
The process of data mining becomes effective when the challenges or problems are correctly recognized and adequately resolved.
Although data mining is very powerful, it faces many challenges during its execution.
Data mining provides meaningful patterns and turning data into information.
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is all about obtaining and holding Customers, also enhancing customer loyalty and implementing customer-oriented strategies.
Education data mining is a newly emerging field, concerned with developing techniques that explore knowledge from the data generated from educational Environments.
Data mining enables a retailer to use point-of-sale records of customer purchases to develop products and promotions that help the organization to attract the customer.
Different data mining instruments operate in distinct ways due to the different algorithms used in their design.
The data mining techniques are not precise, so that it may lead to severe consequences in certain conditions.
Many data mining analytics software is difficult to operate and needs advance training to work on.
There is a probability that the organizations may sell useful data of customers to other organizations for money.
It is a quick process that makes it easy for new users to analyze enormous amounts of data in a short time.
It can be induced in the new system as well as the existing platforms.
Data Mining helps the decision-making process of an organization.
Compared with other statistical data applications, data mining is a cost-efficient.
Data mining enables organizations to make lucrative modifications in operation and production.
The Data Mining technique enables organizations to obtain knowledge-based data.
The Data Repository generally refers to a destination for data storage.
A relational database is a collection of multiple data sets formally organized by tables, records, and columns from which data can be accessed in various ways without having to recognize the database tables
The biggest challenge is to analyze the data to extract important information that can be used to solve a problem or for company development
Data Mining is a process used by organizations to extract specific data from huge databases to solve business problems.
It primarily turns raw data into useful information.
Data mining is the act of automatically searching for large stores of information to find trends and patterns that go beyond simple analysis procedures.
the useful data that would allow the business to take the data-driven decision from huge sets of data is called Data Mining.
The knowledge discovery process includes Data cleaning, Data integration, Data selection, Data transformation, Data mining, Pattern evaluation, and Knowledge presentation.
Data mining is also called Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD). 
Data mining has considerable benefit for other business areas. 
Data mining becomes more useful and valuable with bigger data sets and with more user experience. 
The primary benefit of data mining is its power to identify patterns and relationships in large volumes of data from multiple sources.
The real inflection point came in the 1960s with the development of relational database technology and user-oriented natural language query tools like Structured Query Language (SQL).
No longer was data only available through custom coded programs.
Data mining has traditionally been a specialty skill set within data science.
Data mining is a key component of business intelligence. Data mining tools are built into executive dashboards, harvesting insight from Big Data, including data from social media, Internet of Things (IoT) sensor feeds, etc.
There are about as many approaches to data mining as there are data miners.
Your internal systems and databases. Link them through their data models and various relational tools or gather the data together into a data warehouse. 
Keep in mind that data mining is based on a tool kit rather than a fixed routine or process.
